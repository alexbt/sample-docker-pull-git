Dockerfile - building a git project
-------------------
This project showcases how you can use Docker to fetch a git project, build it and Dockerize it.

The Dockerfile I'm using is as simple as this:
```
FROM junhanlin/ubuntu-git-java-maven
VOLUME /tmp

RUN git clone https://github.com/alexturcot/helloworld-docker-pull-git.git
WORKDIR example-docker-build-git-project
RUN mvn install

WORKDIR target
RUN mv *.jar app.jar

ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/example-docker-build-git-project/target/app.jar"]
````


In order to perform the *git clone* and *mvn install*, the image needs to have git installed, jdk8 and maven as well. I looked around and found **junhanlin/ubuntu-git-java-maven**'s Dockerfile
Using his Dockerfile as a foundation, all that is left in my Dockerfile is to:

* fetch the project from git: RUN git clone https://github.com/alexturcot/helloworld-docker-pull-git.git
* build it with maven: RUN mvn install
* launch the application at startup: ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/example-docker-build-git-project/target/app.jar"]

To install docker, follow their instrution: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation

**build a docker image**

The first step is to create a Dockerfile. You may download the Dockerfile from this repository and drop it where you wish.
Then go into the folder containing your Dockerfile (or the one from this reository) and type:

    $ docker build -t example-spring-boot-docker:latest .

    ```
    Sending build context to Docker daemon 160.8 kB

    ```

This builds your first docker image.
Once it's done, you can view the images added to your local repository:
    $ docker images
``
REPOSITORY                        TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
example-spring-boot-docker        latest              226b42be11a0        3 minutes ago       871.2 MB
junhanlin/ubuntu-git-java-maven   latest              c0e8627e844e        12 weeks ago        790.7 MB
```

** Launch your container **

To launch the container (a running image is referred to as a container, kind of like a Class and an Object)

    $ docker run -e spring_profiles_active=dev -p 8080:8080 -i -t example-spring-boot-docker:latest

In my case, the entrypoint of my container is a spring boot application.
* -e spring_profiles_active=dev  is to provide set a spring profile
* -p 8080:8080 is to open port on the docker container, so that I can reach it from my computer.

You can browse to http://localhost:8080/docker, to access the dockerized application. That's it.
